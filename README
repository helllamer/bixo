Introduction
===============================

Bixo is an open source Java web mining toolkit that runs as a series of Cascading
pipes. It is designed to be used as a tool for creating customized web mining apps.
By building a customized Cascading pipe assembly, you can quickly create a workflow
using Bixo that fetches web content, parses, analyzes, and publishes the results.

Bixo borrows heavily from the Apache Nutch project, as well as many other open source
projects at Apache and elsewhere.

Bixo is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Building
===============================

You need fresh "cascading.utils".

$ git clone https://github.com/ScaleUnlimited/cascading.utils/ cascading-utils-git
$ cd cascading-utils-git

Maybe, modify pom.xml deps and set property "cascading.version" to something like "2.2.0-wip-15" 
or any other available on conjars.org. And build it.
$ mvn package -DskipTests

And add ready-to-use jar into with similar command:
$ mnv install:install-file -DgroupId=com.scaleunlimited -DartifactId=cascading.utils -Dversion=2.1-SNAPSHOT -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=target/cascading.utils-2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Checkout bixo for cascading-2.1:

$ cd ..
$ git clone https://github.com/helllamer/bixo
$ git checkout cascading-2.1

And build bixo and demo-crawler (see examples/) *somehow*. Something like this (untested):
$ ant jar
$ cd examples/
$ ant jar


To create Eclipse project files:

% ant eclipse

Then, from Eclipse follow the standard procedure to import an existing Java project into your Workspace.
